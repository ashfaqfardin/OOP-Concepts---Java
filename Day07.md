**Day 7 - Composition, Aggregation, and Design Patterns**

**Composition and Aggregation**
- Composition and aggregation are ways to represent relationships between objects.
- Composition implies a strong "whole-part" relationship, where the part cannot exist without the whole.
- Aggregation implies a "has-a" relationship, where the part can exist independently.

**Design Patterns**
- Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.
- Some popular design patterns include Singleton, Factory, Observer, and more.
