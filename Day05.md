**Day 5 - Constructors, Destructors, and Access Modifiers**

**Constructors**
- Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created.
- They have the same name as the class and have no return type.

**Destructors**
- Java does not have destructors like some other programming languages.
- Instead, Java uses garbage collection to automatically free up memory when objects are no longer referenced.

**Access Modifiers (Review)**
- Recall the access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default.
